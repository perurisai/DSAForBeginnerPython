"""
The Painters Partition Problem is a classic problem that involves finding the minimum amount of time required to paint all boards, given that you have multiple painters and each painter takes the same amount of time to paint a unit of board. The goal is to minimize the time taken to paint all the boards when the boards are divided among the painters.
Problem Statement:
You are given n boards of lengths L1, L2, ..., Ln.
You have k painters.
A painter paints continuously from one board to another.
The time taken to paint a board of length Li is Li units of time.
You need to find the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraint that:
The painters can paint continuously, but a painter can only paint a contiguous section of boards.
You cannot split a board between two painters.
Approach:
This problem can be solved efficiently using binary search combined with a greedy approach.
Binary Search for the Optimal Time:
The lower bound for the time is the time taken by the painter to paint the largest board (because no painter can paint faster than the largest single board).
The upper bound for the time is the sum of all board lengths (if only one painter were to paint all boards).
Perform binary search on this range to find the minimum time.
Greedy Check:
For each mid value (possible maximum time), check if it's possible to paint all boards with the given number of painters within that time using a greedy approach.

            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1

    return low


# Example usage:
boards = [10, 20, 30, 40]
num_painters = 2
result = find_minimum_time(boards, num_painters)
print(f"Minimum time required to paint all boards: {result}")

"""
Explanation:
Binary Search:
We perform a binary search between low (the time to paint the largest board) and high (the time to paint all boards together).
In each iteration, calculate mid as the possible maximum time a painter can work.
Greedy Check:
The function can_paint_all_boards() checks whether it is possible to paint all boards with the given mid time using the available painters.
If it is possible (True), we know we can try for a smaller mid (decrease high).
If it is not possible (False), we need more time, so we increase low.
Termination:
The loop terminates when low equals high, at which point we have found the minimum time required to paint all boards.
Example:
For the boards [10, 20, 30, 40] and 2 painters:
The optimal way to partition the boards could be [10, 20, 30] for one painter and [40] for another, or [10, 20] for one painter and [30, 40] for another.
The minimum time required to paint all boards would be 60.
Complexity:
Time Complexity: 
O(nlogS), where 
n is the number of boards and 
S is the sum of all board lengths. The binary search runs in 
O(logS), and the greedy check runs in 
O(n).
Space Complexity: 
O(1), as no additional space is used except for a few variables.
This approach efficiently finds the minimum time required to paint all the boards by utilizing a combination of binary search and greedy methods.
